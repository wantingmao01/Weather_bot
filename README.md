# Rasa Weather bot
## About this repo
This is a weather bot created following the [tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/chatbots-using-python-and-rasa/). Ideally, this bot will return the weather of the requested location and conduct simple conversations. However, since the I cannot find an perfect api, it can only reply "it's sunny". This weather bot is also currently a Slack app, so that user can interact with this bot through Slack.

## How to run it?
1. Download all files.
3. In a command prompt window, go to the directory of files and run `rasa run actions`.
4. Open a new command prompt window and run `rasa shell`.

## Something to notice
The model of this bot is not very accurate, so it may give some inappropriate replies. More examples are needed to fix this issue.
