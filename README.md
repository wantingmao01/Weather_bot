## About this repo
This is the final project of the DSC106 @UCSD instructed by Professor Soohyun Nam Liao during Spring 2023. The data mainly based on [a kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/rotten-tomatoes-top-movies-ratings-and-technical), whereas information about ethinicity is from [wikipedia data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots). Thanks for collecting of those data which makes my data visualization possible. In this project, I meant to deliver what elements created good movies with the help of three svg plots(scatter plot, goemetric plot, and network plot). For the scatter plot and geometric plot, a ticker will appear when mouse is over data points, introducing the basic information of movies. Also, both the geometric and network plot are able to zoom in and out. You may refer to report.pdf for my intention in the design of this visualization.

## How to run it?
1. Download all files in code folder.
2. Make sure all data files, images and other files are in the same folder.
3. Use live server to check index.html and enjoy the interaction!

## Something to notice
1. report.pdf includes the intention and outline of the design as well as a prototype of the webpage.
2. screenshot.pdf, as the name indicates, is the screenshot of the webpage. If the setup was correct, the visualization should be the same as screenshots.
3. data_preprocessing folder includes raw data and two .ipynb files. explore1.ipynb is the process of combining two datasets and data exploration. explore2.ipynb is the process of generating data.json that is for network plot. These files lack comments and explanation on each step, and I'll further fix this problem.
4. I recommend open the whole code folder with VS code, and open index.html with live server.
